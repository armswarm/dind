[![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/armswarm/docker/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/armswarm/docker)

Heavily borrows from upstream (https://github.com/docker-library/docker/) but is slightly slimmed down and oriented for building an ARM image.

Builds the `docker` image and the `dind` image, tagged the same way as in upstream.
